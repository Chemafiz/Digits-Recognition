## Real-time number recognition program using various types of ML models.  
Digit recognition is one of the first projects undertaken when embarking on the journey into Machine Learning. I decided to take it a step further and combine various approaches into one. I trained three different models:

1. Supervised Learning: This was more of an experiment to see how well "classical" Machine Learning would perform in a Computer Vision task. I used the XGBoost algorithm.
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): The fundamental model for Computer Vision is the CNN.
3. CNN with Data Augmentation: To enhance generalization and reduce variance, I incorporated data augmentation techniques.

I wrapped all three models into a simple real-time program for recognizing user-written numbers.
